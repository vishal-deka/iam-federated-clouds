# Identity and Access Management for Federated Cloud

In this project, we simulate the mechanism of giving users access to  two dummy clouds, namely Cloud Red and Cloud Blue, with a common set of credentials.
These credentials are verified in a third application called the Private Cloud. On verification, a database is looked up that contains the roles that users have in each cloud. 
Accordingly, the user is redirected to the chosen cloud service. This way, an organization that is subscribed to multiple clouds, can ensure only priviledged users get to use the resources.

## Identity Federation and SAML

Identity federation is usually enabled through SAML. In this simulation, we use JSON to establish trust between the clouds and the private cloud. The JSON will be generated by the private cloud once an user is verified and posted to the clouds.
The public cloud and the private cloud share a key that is required to validate the JSON.

## Further extention

We aim to integrate this with WebAuthn to allow passwordless access to users.
